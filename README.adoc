Vert.x Maven Starter
A minimally functional server application with a REST API using the VertX framework.
The application uses three verticals: http server, file downloader and file saver

Prerequisites

Apache Maven

JDK 8+

Getting started
Create your project with:

git clone https://github.com/mngerasimenko/wertxapp.git <PROJECT_NAME>
Replace PROJECT_NAME with the name of your project.

Once you have retrieved the project, you can check that everything works with:

mvp clean package
mvn exec:java
The command compiles the project and runs the tests,
then it launches the application, so you can check by yourself.

Open your browser to http://localhost:8080/status.
You should see in response json: {"status": "running"}

Building the project
To build the project, just use:

mvn clean package
It generates a fat-jar in the target directory.

run this file: java -jar starter-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar

Then we may send POST request with body json to http://localhost:8080/
for example: {"url": "https://cbr.ru/vfs/mcirabis/BIK/okv.zip"}

The file must be downloaded from the server and saved to the local folder(by default "downloadedFiles\")

We may change the port and download folder use config file.
Sample file configuration :
{"http": {"port": 8080},"file": {"download.path": "downloads\\"}}
The config file should be named "config.json" and located in classpath.
